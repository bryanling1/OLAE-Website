## Project History

- **2017:** Originally Branded ESHA (ESports for High school Association), Clubs are established at Waterloo Collegiate and Waterloo Oxford as a part of the club development program on a static web-page generated by naive python functions by some high school randos.

- **2018:** ESHA re-brands to OLAE and runs a private provincial tournament including select 8 teams from the GTA after a lack of support from the school board. Platform transfers to PHP and MySQL for user login support

- **2019-onward:** High schoolers enter university and make the program public, running a pre-season with 12 teams from 6 schools ahead of the 2020 regular season. Platform transfers to node.js and React for real-time matchmaking and API support. 

## Details
- **Front-end:** React-Redux Firebase combo for matchmaking, competitor statistics, and site modules (schedules, leaderboards, etc.)

- **Back-end:** Simple node.js proxy server to acceess [RIOT's API](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis) for match result requests
